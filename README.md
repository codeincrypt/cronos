Features of Cronos
### EVM-Compatible
Ethereum developers are used to smart contract capabilities as Ethermint can support any smart contracts, DAOs or Dapps deployed on Ethereum.
### Scalable
Tendermint can process a higher number of transactions per minute as compared to EVM, making it faster, cheaper, and more eco-friendly to execute smart contracts.
### Interoperable
IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other, interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

## Easy Deployment
Users can follow the deployment instructions to quickly and easily deploy to the Cronos network for their own usage purposes.
Crypto.com ecosystem
Gain access to an ecosystem of over 50 million users.
